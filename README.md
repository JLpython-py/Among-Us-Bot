The AmongUs-MapBot is a Discord bot which acts as an easily-accessible database of Among Us. Members of guilds with this bot can interact with the bot to quickly reference this information.

<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>Map Database</h2>

This repository has data about nearly all aspect of the Among Us maps. Member of guilds can use a sent of comprehensive commands to reference the available data. [See more details](https://github.com/JLpython-py/AmongUs-MapBot/wiki/MapInfo).

**Coming Soon: Data from the soon-to-be-released _Airship_ map has already been compiled. On the day the map is released, the available data will be released.**

<h3>Random Among Us</h2>

Just like its name implies, this feature allows members to generate a random map, a random number of impostors, and a random option for a specific setting or for all the in-game settings. [See more details](https://github.com/JLpython-py/AmongUs-MapBot/wiki/RandomAmongUs).

<h3>Coming Soon: Voice Channel Control</h3>

Members in the guild can claim a voice channel and, when claimed, that member can control the voices and statuses of other members in that voice channel. Rather than a set of commands, the feature utilizes emojis attached to an embed for the member to use. [See more details]().

<h2>Command Guide</h2>

A command guide for each of the cogs of the bot can be found in the repository's [Wiki](https://github.com/JLpython-py/AmongUs-MapBot/wiki).

<h2>Installation</h2>

The bot requires the following permissions turned on to function properly, but they can be turned off in channels where the bot is not needed:

| General Permissions | Text Permissions | Voice Permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| View Channels | Send Messages | Mute Members |
| | Embed Links | Deafen Members |
| | Attach Files | Move Members |
| | Read Message History | |
| | Add Reactoins | |

Add the [AmongUs MapBot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=793568531757137970&permissions=117824&scope=bot) to your guild.
